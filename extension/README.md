# CFlow - an attempt to recreate TensorFlow

CFlow was developed as an extension to the [C project](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/computing/computing-first-year/) at the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) at Imperial College London.

## Motivation
We chose this project to gain an understanding of how deep learning models function under the hood and develop our C programming and team working skills.

CFlow attempts to emulate the [Keras Functional API](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/). What this means is that developers should be able to use CFlow to make neural networks with many input and output heads.

## Documentation
Like Tensorflow, CFlow represents neural networks as
